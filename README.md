Example case to accompany the publication of 'Reduced Order Modeling of a Supersonic Flow Field' in the Journal of Propulsion and Power.

The function DisturbanceMagnitude.m can be used to find the input files necessary to run the function DisturbanceTransientResponse.m

Loading Step_Inupt.mat to the workspace and running DisturbanceTransientResponse.m will reproduce the SDSM(PHASTA data) solution seen in Fig.13.

Loading 500Hz_Inupt.mat to the workspace and running DisturbanceTransientResponse.m will reproduce the SDSM(PHASTA data) solution seen in Fig.14.
